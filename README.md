# wheelchair-IoT
A web and mobile application that allows nurses to easily manage their patients’ wheelchair cushion lifecycle based on their individual requirements

Beta App Features: The application will consist of three pages (features separated by pages): 
1. Nurse Authentication 2. Patient Form 3. Patient Wheelchair Usage.  


1. Nurse Authentication - An existing nurse will be able to authenticate her credentials to access her patient information.  A new nurse will be able to create a new account and link with her existing patients. 

2. Patient Form - A nurse will be able to add a new patient or edit an existing patient’s information in the system. The nurse will be able to change the patient’s care to another nurse as well as change the patient’s wheelchair cushion number.

3. Patient Wheelchair Usage - A nurse will be able to see all of their patient’s information at a click of a button.  The main graph will display how much ‘spring-rate’ is left in that patient’s wheelchair cushion. Spring rate will be defined as the amount of compressions left in a particular wheelchair’s lifecycle.  This page will also highlight cushions with low spring-rates (under 15%) to the nurse
